# MTG Deckbuilder Capstone

'MTG Deckbuilder' is a deck building app that lets you create custom decks for the collectible card game 'Magic: The Gathering'.

The reason I created this app, is because I've been an avid player for many years, and wanted a virtual space where I could create decks so I didn't have to take up so much physical space in my home with cards.

## Tech Stack:

-  `Front End:` HTML5, CSS3, ES6, React
-  `Back End:` Node.js, Express.js, Mocha, Chai, PostgreSQL
-  `Dev Environment:` Heroku, Vercel

## Demo:

- https://mtg-deckbuilder.vercel.app/

#### Lessons Learned:
- taking the time to properly design your database structure will save you a lot of headache later on.
- don't leave styling until the very end. style throughout.

  

#### What I would Do Differently:

- have components show on the User page instead of routing to each individual component.
- structure and spend my time more effectively by breaking down the tasks at hand in a trello board.
- style throughout building the front end.
